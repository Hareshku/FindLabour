FindLabour is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between customers and skilled labourers. Customers can create job posts, explore worker profiles, chat in real time, and provide ratings after the work is completed. Labourers can browse available opportunities, filter jobs by category, send proposals, communicate with clients, and rate customers based on their overall interaction and behavior.
The platform ensures a smooth, transparent, and efficient hiring experience for both sides.
